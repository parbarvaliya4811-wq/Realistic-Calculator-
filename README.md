# Realistic-Calculator-

## 📌 Description
This project is a realistic, web-based calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed to look and behave like a real physical calculator, including a large display, button click effects, and advanced calculator functions.

## ⚙️ Features
- Basic arithmetic operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division)
- Memory functions (MC, MR, MS, M+, M-)
- Percentage calculation
- Square, square root, and reciprocal functions
- Sign toggle (+ / -)
- Grand Total (GT)
- Keyboard input support
- Error handling (e.g., division by zero)
- Realistic UI with button press effects and sounds

## 🛠️ How It Works
The calculator uses JavaScript logic to manage user input, selected operations, and calculations. Button clicks and keyboard inputs update the display dynamically. The internal `Calculator` class handles operations, memory storage, formatting numbers, and error states.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Structuring JavaScript using classes
- Handling user input from both buttons and keyboard
- Managing calculator state (current value, previous value, operations)
- Building a realistic UI using CSS
- Implementing error handling and edge cases

## 💻 Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## 👤 Created By
Created by me as a learning project to practice JavaScript logic, UI design, and interactive web development.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add scientific calculator functions
- Extend it into financial calculators like SIP or Lumpsum
